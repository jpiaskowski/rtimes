`rtimes` is a collection of functions to search and acquire data from various New York Times APIs,
some of which now live at Propublica.

Functions in `rtimes` that wrap these APIs are prefixed by two letter acronyms fo reach API + the function name itself, e.g.: `cg` + `fxn`

* `cg` for the [Congress API](https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/)
* `as` for the [Article Search API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/articlesearch-product/1/overview)
* `cf` for the [Campaign Finance API](https://propublica.github.io/campaign-finance-api-docs)
* `geo` for the [Geographic API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/geo-product/1/routes/query.json/get)

Please get your own API keys at <http://developer.nytimes.com/> for `as` and `geo`
functions, and for `cg` and `cf` functions by emailing Propublica at [apihelp@propublica.org](mailto:apihelp@propublica.org).

With recent changes at NYTimes APIs, you can use the same key for all APIs

Same for Propublica, get one key to use for all their APIs.


**IMPORTANT**: NYT updated their developer portal recently - API keys with colons are no longer supported.
If you are still using the older NYT API keys with colons, you'll need to crop your current key at the first
colon. For example: `aaaaa:12:34567890` becomes `aaaaa`

Data from the New York Times API is provided by The New York Times.

And data from Propublica API is provided by Propublica

I set up the functions so that you can put the key in your `.Renviron` file (or any
file on your system that holds env vars), which will be called on startup of R, and then you
don't have to enter your API key for each run of a function. Use the following env var names

* `NYTIMES_API_KEY` - for `as` and `geo` methods
* `PROPUBLICA_API_KEY` - for `cg` and `cf` methods
