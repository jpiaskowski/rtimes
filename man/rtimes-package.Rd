\description{
Interface to the Congress and Campaign Finance APIs from Propublica, and
the Article Search and Geographic 'APIs' from the New York Times.
}
\details{
Backstory is that the Congress and Campaign finance APIs used to be part of
NYTimes, but were taken over by Propublica.
}
\section{rtimes API}{

Functions that wrap these sets of APIs are prefixed by two letter
acronyms fo reach API endpoint + the function name itself as for example
\code{cg} + \code{fxn}

\itemize{
\item as - for the Article Search API (Docs:
\url{http://developer.nytimes.com/article_search_v2.json})
\item geo - for the Geographic API (Docs:
\url{http://developer.nytimes.com/geo_api_v2.json})
\item cg - for the Congress API (Docs:
\url{https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/})
\item cf - for the Campaign Finance API (Docs:
\url{https://propublica.github.io/campaign-finance-api-docs/})
}

See the vignette for help.
}

\section{Authentication}{

Get your own API keys for NYTimes APIs at
\url{https://developer.nytimes.com/accounts/create} - you can use one API key for
both the article search and geo NYTimes APIs.

Get your Propublica API key for Congress and Campaign Finance APIs at either
\url{https://www.propublica.org/datastore/api/propublica-congress-api} or
\url{https://www.propublica.org/datastore/api/campaign-finance-api} - as far
as I know, you can use the same key for both APIs

We set up the functions so that you can put the key in your \code{.Renviron}
file, which will be called on startup of R, and then you don't have to enter
your API key for each run of a function. Add entries for an R session like

\itemize{
\item \code{Sys.setenv(NYTIMES_API_KEY = "YOURKEYHERE")}
\item \code{Sys.setenv(PROPUBLICA_API_KEY = "YOURKEYHERE")}
}

Or set them across sessions by putting entries in your \code{.Renviron} file
like

\itemize{
\item \code{NYTIMES_API_KEY=<yourkey>}
\item \code{PROPUBLICA_API_KEY=<yourkey>}
}

You can also pass in your key in a function call, but be careful not to
expose your keys in code committed to public repositories. If you do pass
in a function call, use e.g., \code{Sys.getenv("NYTIMES_API_KEY")}
}

\section{Rate limits}{

Rate limits vary for the different APIs:

\itemize{
\item Article Search API: 1/sec, 1,000/day
\item Geographic API: 5/sec, 1,000/day
\item Congress API: 2/sec, 5,000/day
\item Campaign Finance API: 50/sec, 5,000/day
}
